## About

Animal Chess is based on the classic "Dou Shou Qi" (Fight of Animals). Players move animal pieces with different abilities across a board with water, traps, and dens. The goal: reach the opponent‚Äôs den or capture all their pieces.

## Features

- 8 animal pieces, each with unique strengths and different moves
- Text and graphical interfaces
- AI opponents using Deep Q-Networks
- Train your own AI models

## Quick Start

**Requirements:**  
- C++14 compiler  
- X11 libraries (for graphics)  
- Make

**Install & Run:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurizheng/animalchess.git

make all
./animalchess               # Play (human vs human)
./animalchess -ai           # Play vs AI
./animalchess -graphics     # Play with graphics
./aitrain                   # Train AI (1000 games)
```

## AI Overview

- Deep Q-Network with 4-layer neural net
- Learns by self-play and experience replay
- Board state as 396-feature vector
- 32 possible actions (8 pieces √ó 4 directions)

## Training AI

```bash
./aitrain -games 5000      # Train for 5000 games
./aitrain -graphics        # Watch training
```
Tips: Start with a few thousand games, test, then train more. Models save automatically.

## Game Rules

- **Animals:** Rat(1) < Cat(2) < Dog(3) < Wolf(4) < Leopard(5) < Tiger(6) < Lion(7) < Elephant(8). With the exception that Rat(1) wins against Elephant(8)
